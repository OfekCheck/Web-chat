## General information
This is an example of a web chat with rooms and a web based graphical user interface that uses flask and sqlite3 libraries.<br />
For using chat you have to open a new room / join an existing room (if there has space).<br />
When opening a new room there is an option to restrict the chat users, while submitting the form witout setting limit the restriction is set to UNLIMITED.<br />
You can join chat from any device on the same network.<br />
On the left side of the chat there is a list of all chat users.<br />
You can leave the room whenever you want and join another room / open a new room.<br />
When you try to connect to any room, make sure the name of the room you typed is correct.<br />
The chat was built for the purpose of learning and improving my code writing.<br />
There is an about page, a page about me that does not belong to the web chat.
